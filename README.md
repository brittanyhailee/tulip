## Tulip 𓍢ִ໋🌷͙֒
(<i>to•live</i>) 
## What it does ദ്ദി ˉ͈̀꒳ˉ͈́ )✧
I made Tulip to help people take a few seconds to write down a good memory that happened during the day, or from weeks or months ago, and remember them later on. What I hope for Tulip to achieve is to help people get through their struggles by remembering the good in their lives. 
## How I built it (๑'ᵕ'๑)⸝*
* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS, TypeScript
* Database: IndexedDB

## What I learned ( ◡̀_◡́)ᕤ
Starting this project was nerve-wracking, as my goal in building this application is important to me. However, I accomplished one of the most difficult things, and that is, to start. I learned a lot along the way, such as configuring module bundlers, and using the IndexedDB API! 
## More to come (˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶)
I am still working on including more features, such as sentiment analysis, to garner the user's mood and pick the best memory for it. Please look forward to it!
