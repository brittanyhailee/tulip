## Tulip 𓍢ִ໋🌷͙֒
(<i>to•live</i>) 
## What it does ⋆౨ৎ˚⟡˖ ࣪
I made Tulip to help people take a few seconds to write down a good memory that happened during the day, or from weeks or months ago, and remember them later on. What I hope for Tulip to achieve is to help people get through their struggles by remembering the good in their lives.

* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS, TypeScript
* Database: IndexedDB
